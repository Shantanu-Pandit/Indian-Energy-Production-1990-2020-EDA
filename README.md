India's Energy Production from 1990-2020 (EDA)

About Dataset

Data on Energy by Our World in Data
This dataset is a collection of key metrics maintained by Our World in Data. It is updated regularly and includes data on energy consumption (primary energy, per capita, and growth rates), energy mix, electricity mix, and other relevant metrics


The dataset was re-worked for data visualization
The original dataset 'World Energy Consumption' created by Our World in Data has been transformed to show Indian Electricity Production and consumption patterns from 1990-2020.
As a result, I have used the final outcome for visualization purposes.
Original dataset by Our World in Data: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pralabhpoudel/world-energy-consumption
Information has been taken to fulfill missing values (GDP, population) from: https://data.worldbank.org
Domain: Energy
Context:
This project mainly focuses on data analysis of India's energy production and consumption of electricity from various sources such as renewable and non-renewable energy sources (Hydropower, Coal, Solar, Nuclear, etc.). Trends, Percentage of share between different sources, and comparisons have been done from the year 1990-2020.
